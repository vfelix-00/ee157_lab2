## Part 1: Resistance measurements

### 1a. Determine how to correlate electrical frequency to angular velocity.To do this we count number of poles in the stator. For the motors we will be using, the number of poles will equal the number magnets.

np = 14

f = 673.93 Hz

w [rad/sec] = (pi)(673.93 Hz) / 14 = 151.23 rad/sec

### 1b. Measure line-to-line  

resistance of the leads = 0.1 ohms 


resistance of an individual phase winding = 0.26 ohms 


measured resistance of 1 phase winding - resistance of the leads =  0.26 ohms  - 0.1 ohms  = 0.16 ohms 

Measured line-to-line coil resistance =  2x the resistance of an individual phase winding = 0.16 ohms * 2  = 0.32 ohms
