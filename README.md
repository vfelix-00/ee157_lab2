# EE 157 Motor and Drives

## Introduction 

In this lab, we reviewed 3-phase systems and experimentally determined basic motor constants (Kb, Kùúè, etc.). We then calculated eddy current losses and hystersis loss. 

### Materials 

1. Current probe 
2. Voltage and current scope 
3. ESC
4. 1000 kV motor 
5. 14000 kV motor
6. Multimeter 
7. Power Supply

## Procedure 

For the set up, the input of the ESC was connected to a 5V power supply. The output of the ESC was connected to a hobby motor. The hobby motor was taped down so that it could spin in a stable manner. 





## Results 

### 1000 kV Motor

#### Part 1: Resistance measurements

##### 1a. Angular Velocity

We correlated electrical frequency to angular velocity by counting the number of poles in the stator. For the motors we used, the number of poles was equal to the number magnets.

np = 14

f = 673.93 Hz

w [rad/sec] = (pi)(673.93 Hz) / 14 = 151.23 rad/sec

### 1b. Line-to-line coil resistance

resistance of the leads = 0.1 ohms 


resistance of an individual phase winding = 0.26 ohms 


measured resistance of 1 phase winding - resistance of the leads =  0.26 ohms  - 0.1 ohms  = 0.16 ohms 

Measured line-to-line coil resistance =  2x the resistance of an individual phase winding = 0.16 ohms * 2  = 0.32 ohms

#### Part 2: Determining the back EMF constant 

##### 2a. Back EMF constant 

We measured the back EMF by spinning up the motor under power, and then cutting off the power to the ESC (the motor drive component) and then quickly capturing the back EMF as the motor spun down with the ESC off.

Meaaure values using scope:

Vpeak-to-peak = 1.8 V (amplitude)

I = 20.1mA

Vphase = Vpeak = 0.9V

Vline-to-line = sqrt(3) * Vphase

Vline-to-line,rms = sqrt(3/2) * Vphase

Vline-to-line,rms = 1.102

Kb = Vline-to-line,rms/omega = 1.102 / 151.23 rad/sec = 0.00729

Vemf = Vline-to-line - IRline-to-line = (sqrt(3) * 0.9V) - (20.1mA * 0.32 ohms) = 1.559 V

#### Part 3: Km

Now that we have Kb (and can deduce Kt), we found the motor constant, Km, using the resistance we measured.

for a 3-phase motor:

k_T = sqrt(3) * k_b = sqrt(3) * 0.00729 = 0.0126 

k_m = Tavg / sqrt(Ploss) = (k_T* i_rms) / sqrt(i_rms^2 * Rcoil = k_T / sqrt(Rcoil) = 0.0126 / sqrt(0.32 ohms) = 0.0223 Nm/ sqrt(w)
