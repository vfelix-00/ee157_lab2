## Part 1: Resistance measurements

### 1a. Determine how to correlate electrical frequency to angular velocity.To do this we count number of poles in the stator. For the motors we will be using, the number of poles will equal the number magnets.

np = 14

f = 673.93 Hz

w [rad/sec] = (pi)(673.93 Hz) / 14 = 151.23 rad/sec

### 1b. Measure line-to-line (also often call phase-to-phase) coil resistance (remember this will by 2x 
the resistance of an individual phase winding). 

resistance of the leads = 0.1 ohms 


measured LL resistance = 0.26 ohms 


total LL resistance =  0.26 ohms  - 0.1 ohms  = 0.16 ohms
